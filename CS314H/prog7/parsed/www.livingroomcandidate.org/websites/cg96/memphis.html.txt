Characters:    "So, we are beginning. We are trying to pass a bill to make\n\r    our people safer, to put another 100,000 police officers on the\n\r    streets, to provide boot camps instead of prisons for young\n\r    people who could still be rescued—(applause)—to provide more\n\r    safety in our schools, to restrict the availability of these\n\r    awful assault weapons, to pass the Brady Bill and at least\n\r    require people to have their criminal background checked before\n\r    they get a gun, and to say, if you’re not old enough to vote\n\r    and you’re not old enough to go to war, you ought not to own a\n\r    handgun and you ought not to use one unless you’re on a target\n\r    range.

And, when the Congress comes back next year, we\n\r    will be moving forward on that. We need this crime bill now. We\n\r    ought to give it to the American people for Christmas. And we\n\r    need to move forward on all these other fronts. But I say to\n\r    you, my fellow Americans, we need some other things as well. I\n\r    do not believe we can repair the basic fabric of society until\n\r    people who are willing to work have work."

And we must find a way, through public and private\n\r    sources, to enhance the attractiveness of the American people\n\r    who live there to get investment there. We cannot—I submit to\n\r    you—repair the American community and restore the American\n\r    family until we provide the structure, the values, the\n\r    discipline, and the reward that work gives.

Characters:    "I read a wonderful speech the other day, given at Howard\n\r    University, in a lecture series funded by Bill and Camille\n\r    Cosby, in which the speaker said,&nbsp;“I grew up in Anacostia\n\r    years ago. Even then it was all Black and it was a very poor\n\r    neighborhood. But, you know, when I was a child in Anacostia—a\n\r    100 percent African American neighborhood, a very poor\n\r    neighborhood—we had a crime rate that was lower than the\n\r    average of the crime rate of our city. Why? Because we had\n\r    coherent families. We had coherent communities. The people who\n\r    filled the church on Sunday lived in the same place they went\n\r    to church. The guy that owned the drug store lived down the\n\r    street. The person that owned the grocery store lived in our\n\r    community. We were whole.” And I say to you, we have to make\n\r    our people whole again. This church has stood for that. Why do\n\r    you think you have 5 million members in this country?"

Characters:    "So, I say to you, we have to make a partnership—all the\n\r    government agencies, all the business folks. But where there\n\r    are no families, where there is no order, where there is no\n\r    hope, where we are reducing the size of armed services because\n\r    we have won the Cold War, who will be there to give structure,\n\r    discipline, and love to these children. You must do that and we\n\r    must help you. The scripture says,&nbsp;“You are the salt of\n\r    the earth and the light of the world,” that,&nbsp;“If your\n\r    light shines before men, they will give glory to the Father in\n\r    Heaven.” That is what we must do. That is what we must do. How\n\r    would we explain it to Martin Luther King if he showed up today\n\r    and said,&nbsp;“Yes, we won the Cold War. Yes, the biggest\n\r    threat that all of us grew up under—Communism and nuclear\n\r    war—Communism is gone; nuclear war receding. Yes, we developed\n\r    all of these miraculous technologies. Yes, we all got a VCR in\n\r    our home. It’s interesting. Yes, we get 50 channels on the\n\r    cable. Yes, without regard to race, if you work hard, play by\n\r    the rules, you get into a service academy or a good college,\n\r    you’ll do just great.” How would we explain to him all these\n\r    kids getting killed and killing each other? How would we\n\r    justify the things that we permit that no other country in the\n\r    world would permit? How could we explain that we gave people\n\r    the freedom to succeed and we created conditions in which\n\r    millions abuse that freedom to destroy the things that make\n\r    life worth living and life itself? We cannot."

But unless we deal with the ravages of crime and drugs\n\r    and violence, and unless we recognize that it’s due to the\n\r    breakdown of the family, the community, and the disappearance\n\r    of jobs, and unless we say,&nbsp;“Some of this cannot be done\n\r    by government because we have to reach deep inside to the\n\r    values, the spirit, the soul, and the truth of human nature,”\n\r    none of the other things we seek to do will ever take us where\n\r    we need to go."

We will honor the meaning of our church. We\n\r    will somehow, by God’s grace, we will turn this around. We will\n\r    give these children a future. We will take away their guns and\n\r    give them books. We will take away their despair and give them\n\r    hope. We will rebuild the families and the neighborhoods and\n\r    the communities. We won’t make all the work that has gone on\n\r    here benefit just a few. We will do it together by the grace of\n\r    God.” Thank you. (Applause.)"
