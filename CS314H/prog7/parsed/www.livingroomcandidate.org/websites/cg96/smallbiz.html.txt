Today\n\r            only 24 percent of workers in businesses with fewer\n\r            than 100 employees have pensions. President Clinton�s\n\r            National Employee Savings Trust (NEST) would provide\n\r            benefits similar to those of a 401(k) pension plan and\n\r            would be simple to create and operate.\n\r          "
