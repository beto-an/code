Domestic violence was never taken seriously before.\n\r    Now, many of the people who are leading safer and healthier\n\r    lives, many of the victims who have been helped, many of the\n\r    perpetrators who are no longer able to abuse and violate women\n\r    and children and may have even learned the error of their ways,\n\r    are doing so now because we have made a concerted national\n\r    effort against domestic violence.\""

Across the nation, local\n\r    organizations are holding conferences, vigils, and other events\n\r    to increase awareness and build unity around this disturbing\n\r    issue. Millions of women and children throughout our nation are\n\r    plagued by the terror of family violence each year, and\n\r    approximately 20 percent of all hospital emergency room visits\n\r    by women result from such violence. As many as three million\n\r    children witness violence in their homes each year. It is only\n\r    by stopping violence at home that we will ultimately end\n\r    violence in the streets."
