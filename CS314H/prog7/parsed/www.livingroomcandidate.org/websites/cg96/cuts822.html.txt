Characters:    "\"The center [on Budget and Policy Priorities] points out that Mr. Dole's plan calls for $217 billion in program cuts in addition to the $650 billion in cuts already proposed by the Republican majority in Congress. If all of those cuts are implemented the federal government would not just be downsized, it would be devastated... By 2002, this budget area would be reduced 37 percent below current level, after adjusting for inflation.  Stated another way, 37 percent of the Federal Government, other than entitlements and defense spending, would have to disappear...  If those assumptions are incorrect, and most economists believe they are, Mr. Dole would have to find still more spending cuts, perhaps $150 billion worth. That, according to the center's analysis, would push the total spending cuts required between now and 2002 above $1 trillion. That won't happen. It's not politically doable. What will happen is the same thing that happened under Ronald Reagan. The budget won't be balanced. The deficit, especially in the long term, will grow. And that will cause a drag on the economy that will last well into the 21st century.\"  [New York Times, (Bob Herbert editorial), 8/16/96]\r\n\r\r\n\r"
