Characters:    "What are we to do about it? More than 60 years ago, at the\n\r    dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt told our nation\n\r    new conditions imposed new requirements on government and those\n\r    who conduct government. And from that simple proposition, he\n\r    shaped the New Deal, which helped to restore our nation to\n\r    prosperity and defined the relationship between our people and\n\r    our government for half a century. That approach worked in its\n\r    time, but we today, we face a very different time and very\n\r    different conditions. We are moving from an industrial age\n\r    built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills\n\r    and learning and flexibility. Our government, once a champion\n\r    of national purposes, is now seen by many as simply a captive\n\r    of narrow interests, putting more burdens on our citizens\n\r    rather than equipping them to get ahead. The values that used\n\r    to hold us all together seem to be coming apart. So tonight, we\n\r    must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this\n\r    time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of\n\r    understandings, not just with government but even more\n\r    important with one another as Americans. That’s what I want to\n\r    talk with you about tonight. I call it the New Covenant, but\n\r    it’s grounded in a very, very old idea: that all Americans have\n\r    not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as\n\r    their God-given talents and determination can take them, and to\n\r    give something back to their communities and their country in\n\r    return. Opportunity and responsibility, they go hand in hand;\n\r    we can’t have one without the other, and our national community\n\r    can’t hold together without both. (Applause.) Our new covenant\n\r    is a new set of understanding for how we can equip our people\n\r    to meet the challenges of the new economy, how we can change\n\r    the way our government works to fit a different time, and above\n\r    all, how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and\n\r    come together behind our common purpose."

And let the final test of everything we do\n\r    be a simple one: Is it good for the American people?\n\r    (Applause.) Let me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans\n\r    to be better citizens if we are not better servants.

Three times as many lobbyists are\n\r    in the streets and corridors of Washington as were here 20\n\r    years ago. The American people look at their capital and they\n\r    see a city where the well-connected and the well-protected can\n\r    work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are\n\r    often left out. As the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists\n\r    were still doing business as usual—the gifts, the trips, all\n\r    the things that people are concerned about haven’t stopped.\n\r    Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these\n\r    practices.

We have to help those on welfare\n\r    move to work as quickly as possible, to provide child care and\n\r    teach them skills if that’s what they need, for up to two\n\r    years. But after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule:\n\r    anyone who can work must go to work. (Applause.) If the parent\n\r    isn’t paying child support, they should be forced to pay.\n\r    (Applause.) We should suspend drivers licenses, track them\n\r    across state lines, make them work off what they owe. That is\n\r    what we should do. Governments do not raise children, people\n\r    do, and the parents must take responsibility for the children\n\r    they bring into this world. (Applause.) I want to work with\n\r    you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform. But our goal must\n\r    be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to\n\r    independence, from welfare to work, from mere child-bearing to\n\r    responsible parenting. Our goal should not be to punish them\n\r    because they happen to be poor. (Applause.) We should, we\n\r    should require work and mutual responsibility, but we shouldn’t\n\r    cut people off just because they’re poor, they’re young, or\n\r    even because they’re unmarried. We should promote\n\r    responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with\n\r    their parents or in other supervised settings, by requiring\n\r    them to finish school, but we shouldn’t put them and their\n\r    children out on the street. (Applause.)"

I still don’t think we can in good conscience punish poor\n\r    children for the mistakes of their parents. (Applause.) Now, my\n\r    fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the\n\r    American people care about this without regard to party or race\n\r    or region. So let this be the year we end welfare as we know\n\r    it. But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop\n\r    using this issue to divide America. No one is more eager to end\n\r    welfare. (Applause.)"

I have no problem with punishing bad behavior, or\n\r    the refusal to be a worker or a student, or a responsible\n\r    parent. I just don’t want to punish poverty and past mistakes.\n\r    All of us have made our mistakes, and none of us can change our\n\r    yesterdays, but every one of us can change our tomorrows.\n\r    (Applause.) And America’s best example of that may be Lynn\n\r    Woolsey, who worked her way off welfare to become a\n\r    Congresswoman, from the state of California. (Applause.)"

Characters:    "I know the members of this Congress are concerned about\n\r    crime, as are all the citizens of our country. But I remind you\n\r    that last year we passed a very tough crime bill, longer\n\r    sentences, &nbsp;“Three Strikes and You’re Out,” almost 60 new\n\r    capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention,\n\r    100,000 more police. And we paid for it all by reducing the\n\r    size of the federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to\n\r    local communities to lower the crime rate. There may be other\n\r    things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be smarter with\n\r    crime, to help to lower that rate first. Well, if there are,\n\r    let’s talk about them and let’s do them. But let’s not go back\n\r    on the things that we did last year that we know work, that we\n\r    know work because the local law enforcement officers tell us\n\r    that we did the right thing, because local community leaders\n\r    who’ve worked for years and years to lower the crime rate tell\n\r    us that they work. Let’s look at the experience of our cities\n\r    and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down, and ask\n\r    the people who did it, how they did it. And if what we did last\n\r    year supports the decline"
