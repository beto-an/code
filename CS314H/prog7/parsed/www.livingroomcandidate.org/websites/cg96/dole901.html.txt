Characters:    "Bob Dole is stuck in the old Washington way of\n\r    \"either/or\" politics: choosing between interdiction and\n\r    prevention as a solution to the drug war. It�s a false choice.\n\r    President Clinton has submitted the largest drug budget ever\n\r    that unites enforcement, interdiction and treatment to combat\n\r    drug abuse. The President has continued to use the National\n\r    Guard to help police our borders — and he has increased the\n\r    number of Border Patrol agents on the Southwest border by over\n\r    40 percent."

Dole and Gingrich cut the\n\r    President�s overall drug fighting budget for this year by\n\r    nearly $800 million. Dole and Gingrich voted against the\n\r    President�s expansion of the Safe and Drug Free Schools program\n\r    in 1994. And one of their first actions in 1995 was to cut\n\r    funding for the Safe and Drug Free Schools initiative by 50\n\r    percent. Dole and Gingrich also voted against the President�s\n\r    1994 Anti-Crime bill — which expanded the death penalty for\n\r    drug kingpins, instituted a tough \"three strikes and you�re\n\r    out\" sentence for the most dangerous career criminals and\n\r    provided for drug courts and expanded drug testing."

The President elevated the Drug Czar\n\r    to a Cabinet-level position and appointed four-star General\n\r    Barry McCaffrey — the first Drug Czar with a drug interdiction\n\r    background — to lead the fight against drugs. Year-in and\n\r    year-out, the President has proposed the largest anti-drug\n\r    budgets ever. Under the Clinton Budget now before Congress, the\n\r    DEA would grow by 18% in one year and 116 new DEA agents would\n\r    be added."
