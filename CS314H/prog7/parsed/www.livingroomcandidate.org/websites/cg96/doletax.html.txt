Characters:    "Today, Bob Dole urged the people of New York to take a look at his record.  It�s a record he would be wise to \r\n\rrun away from.  Last year, Bob Dole led the fight for Republican legislation that would have raised taxes on nearly one\r\n\r million New York taxpayers by cutting the Earned Income Tax Credit.  He voted against the Family and Medical \r\n\rLeave Act that protects 3.1 million New York families and blocked raising the minimum wage.\r\n\r"

Just this past Friday, August 16, the Concord Coalition, headed by Republicans Warren\r\n\r Rudman and Pete Peterson and Democrat Paul Tsongas, commented that Dole�s plan \"embodies nearly every pitfall \r\n\rwe warned against,\" in their Sunday, August 4 New York Times full page ad.\r\n\r"

President Clinton also cut taxes for nearly 900,000 of New York�s working \r\n\rfamilies by expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit.   \r\n\r"
