If you’re in your 20s and you’re\n\r    already working, but you can’t move ahead on a high school\n\r    diploma, now you can go back to college. If you’re a mother\n\r    planning to go to work, but you’re afraid you don’t have the\n\r    skills to get a good job, you can go to college. If you’re 40\n\r    and you’re worried that you need more education to support your\n\r    family, now you can go part-time, you can go at night. By all\n\r    means, go to college and we’ll pay the tuition."

When I was the governor of my home\n\r    state, we created academic challenge scholarships that helped\n\r    people who had good grades and who had good behavior to go to\n\r    college. But my proposal today builds mostly on the enormously\n\r    successful HOPE Scholarships in Georgia, which guaranteed any\n\r    student in the state of Georgia free college as long as they\n\r    had a B average. This year those scholarships are helping\n\r    80,000 students in the state of Georgia alone—including 70\n\r    percent of the freshmen class at the University of Georgia."

I’m\n\r    proud to say, as a matter of fact, for the last two years our\n\r    budget has been in surplus, except for the interest necessary\n\r    to pay the debt run up in the several years before I became\n\r    President. So we are doing our best to pay for these programs.\n\r    And this program will be paid for by budgeted savings in the\n\r    balanced budget plan.

And the very few states that have\n\r    tuition above the amount that we can afford to credit, I would\n\r    challenge those states to close the gap. We’re going to take\n\r    care of most of the states. The rest of them should help us the\n\r    last little way."
