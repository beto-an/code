We are firmly committed to those debates and do\n\r    not wish to do anything to obstruct them. The format and\n\r    structure of the debates have become institutionalized after\n\r    refinements that were made over numerous campaign cycles and\n\r    provide an invaluable way to inform the citizens of the country\n\r    about the candidates and their positions."
