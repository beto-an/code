Characters:    "Today Americans received more evidence that President\n\r    Clinton's economic policies have produced an economy that is\n\r    growing strong and steady. The Conference Board reported today\n\r    that consumer confidence about the economy and their future\n\r    prospects is now at it's highest level in six years and is\n\r    nearly double what is was the month before President Clinton\n\r    was elected in 1992."

Under President Clinton�s leadership, the economy has\n\r    produced 10 million new jobs, 93% of which are in the private\n\r    sector, and more than two-thirds of the new jobs are high-wage\n\r    jobs. And, under President Clinton's leadership, the American\n\r    people enjoy the lowest combined unemployment, inflation, and\n\r    mortgage rates in nearly 30 years, and stronger private-sector\n\r    growth than either the Reagan or Bush Administrations."
