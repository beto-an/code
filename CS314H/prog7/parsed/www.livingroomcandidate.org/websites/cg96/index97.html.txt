And\n\r    you know what will happen; it will blow a hole in the deficit.\n\r    That means higher interest rates. That means whatever you get\n\r    in the tax cut, you'll pay right back in your mortgage payment,\n\r    your car payment, your credit card payment. It also means even\n\r    bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the\n\r    environment than I vetoed when they shut the government down. I\n\r    didn't put up with it before, I won't put up with it again. It\n\r    is not the right thing for America. (Applause.)"

That's a pretty song — that big old tax cut. But\n\r    it's like that Contract. Do you remember their Contract? They\n\r    never did say word one about it in San Diego, did they? I\n\r    didn't watch it, but somebody told me they listened intently\n\r    for four days for their record, and they never talked about\n\r    their record and their Contract. Do you remember, it sounded so\n\r    pretty in 1994? And then the consequences came in in '95 and\n\r    '96.
