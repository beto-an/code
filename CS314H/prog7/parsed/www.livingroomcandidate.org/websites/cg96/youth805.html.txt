He signed into law the Student Loan Reform Act making college more affordable for 1.7 million students in 1994 and 1995 and has proposed a scholarship plan to make the first two years of college as universally available as high school.  The President�s new Direct Lending Program provides college students flexible repayment options.  He also created AmeriCorps, which has allowed 45,000 young people to serve in their communities these past two years while earning money for college.  The President expanded the School-to-Work Program for students who are not immediately bound for four-year colleges. \r\n\r\r\n\r"
