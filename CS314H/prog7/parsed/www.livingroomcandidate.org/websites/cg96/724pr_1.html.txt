In the 1994 election approximately eighty\n\r    percent of the Jewish vote went towards Democratic candidates.\n\r    The 1996 Clinton/Gore Jewish Outreach Program seeks to continue\n\r    the grass roots momentum that it launched successfully in the\n\r    1992 election."

Characters:    "\"This election is important to all Jewish Americans\"\n\r    said Ms. Mohile. With the support of the Jewish community,\n\r    President Clinton has won key legislative victories including\n\r    measures protecting religious freedom and the separation\n\r    between church and state; the support of reproductive freedoms;\n\r    making our communities safer by adding police officers and\n\r    banning assault weapons; and passage of the Family and Medical\n\r    Leave Act to secure jobs for workers who have to take time off\n\r    to care for a sick family member. Under President Clinton's\n\r    leadership the American economy is expanding. The Clinton\n\r    Administration has cut the deficit four years in a row and\n\r    reduced the federal workforce to its smallest size since the\n\r    Kennedy Administration."

Characters:    "President Clinton's deep commitment to the US-Israeli\n\r    relationship is clear. The President created the US-Israel\n\r    Science and Technology Commission in 1993, fostering historic\n\r    cooperation between the two governments. President Clinton and\n\r    Vice President Gore combined have visited Israel five times\n\r    since 1992. The United States has overseen a remarkable record\n\r    of achievement toward peace and security in the Middle East\n\r    including the Israeli-Palestinian accords; the peace agreement\n\r    between Israel and Jordan; new regional security and investment\n\r    summits; and Israel's increased acceptance throughout the\n\r    Middle East and the world. President Clinton remains committed\n\r    to America's long-standing special relationship with Israel,\n\r    based on shared values, a mutual commitment to democracy and a\n\r    strategic alliance that benefits both nations. The Jewish\n\r    community has worked with President Clinton to gain support for\n\r    this important agenda."
