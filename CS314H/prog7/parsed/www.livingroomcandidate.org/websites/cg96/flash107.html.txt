In 1995, Bob Dole\n\r    and Newt Gingrich tried to cut Medicare, offering a budget that\n\r    would have reduced Medicare by $270 billion to pay for $245 in\n\r    tax cuts. It�s 1996 and Bob Dole has proposed an economic\n\r    scheme that doubles the tax cut bet to $548 billion. What will\n\r    Bob Dole do to pay for it?"
