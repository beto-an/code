And it may be because a higher and\n\r    higher percentage of our young people come from countries and\n\r    families where English is not their first language. It may be\n\r    because a lot of our young people live in homes where the\n\r    parents are having to work two jobs, sometimes three jobs, and\n\r    don't have enough time to spend with them reading. But for\n\r    whatever reason we know that our reading scores have not\n\r    increased as much as our math and science scores, and we know\n\r    that unless we can read we will not be able to take advantage\n\r    of the future or understand the past."

Let me say\n\r    that one thing I'm really proud of in America is the way the\n\r    business community is moving to change its standards of what's\n\r    good for business. I was proud when I visited that Chrysler\n\r    plant in Toledo that they gave their workers an average bonus\n\r    of $8,000 a year last year because they all made money and they\n\r    thought the workers were entitled to their fair share. I'm\n\r    proud of that. (Applause.)"

Characters:    "But I want you to know something else — when we passed the\n\r    telecommunications bill not very long ago to create hundreds of\n\r    thousands of new jobs in the telecommunications industry, we\n\r    also required new TVs to give you, the parents of this country,\n\r    a V-chip so that parents will be able to control what their\n\r    younger children see and not see inappropriate material.\n\r    (Applause.) But it wouldn't work if the entertainment industry\n\r    hadn't stepped up to the plate and said, we're going to start\n\r    rating television shows the way we rate movies, and we're going\n\r    to give that information to parents and let them make their own\n\r    decisions. And now the entertainment industry is working with\n\r    us to create three hours more of prime time educational\n\r    programming a week in the next couple of years. (Applause.)\n\r    People are moving in the right direction. We need more of\n\r    that."

Characters:    "So let me leave you with this thought — we've got 10 million\n\r    more jobs, a million and a half fewer people on welfare, the\n\r    crime rate is coming down, child support collections are going\n\r    up. America is growing together and going forward, wages are\n\r    rising for the first time in a decade. But the most important\n\r    thing we have to do is to make sure our children are ready for\n\r    the 21st century. And I want you to join with me in saying one\n\r    way we're going to do that is to make sure every single boy and\n\r    girl in America can read on his or her own by the time they're\n\r    in the third grade. Will you do it? (Applause.)"
