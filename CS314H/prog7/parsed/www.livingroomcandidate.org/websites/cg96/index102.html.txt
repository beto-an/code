There are very few labor union members in any\n\r    union that make the minimum wage or anything real close to it.\n\r    But the laboring people of this country, through their\n\r    organized leadership, labored for the minimum wage because they\n\r    want all people who work for a living to have the dignity and\n\r    the reward of work.

And that's why if\n\r    we stay on a path and we balance this budget in the right way —\n\r    I say the right way — we can have a growing economy. The right\n\r    way is to do it without having crippling cuts in the things\n\r    that are important to our future and important to our\n\r    obligations. That means we have to balance the budget without\n\r    cutting back on education, from college loans to Head Start,\n\r    without eroding our protection for the environment, without\n\r    eroding our obligations to people who need help — families with\n\r    disabilities, poor children, the elderly in nursing homes\n\r    through the Medicaid program — and without doing more to\n\r    Medicare than is necessary to balance the budget and stabilize\n\r    the Medicare program. I don't support those excessive cuts, and\n\r    we don't have to have them."

The biggest new\n\r    investment in manufacturing in the last several years is a\n\r    company making recycled paper products in the Bronx. What did\n\r    we do for that company? The main thing we did was just — I\n\r    signed an executive order directing the federal government to\n\r    buy a certain percentage of its products in recycled paper. Now\n\r    a lot of those urban folks are working on a way to help the\n\r    environment, and they've got manufacturing jobs. That's an\n\r    important thing."

Now,\n\r    we have reduced the welfare rolls by a million and a half in\n\r    four years — and I'm proud of that — by moving people from\n\r    welfare to work and requiring people who can work to go to\n\r    work.

We're\n\r    going to guarantee that there will be more money put into child\n\r    care for working poor people, because they can't afford to pay\n\r    it. But we're going to take what used to be the welfare check\n\r    itself, the federal portion and the state portion, we're going\n\r    to let the state decide how to spend that money to try to spend\n\r    it in a way that will move more people from welfare to work and\n\r    put strict time limits on the limit of time that able-bodied\n\r    people can stay on welfare."
