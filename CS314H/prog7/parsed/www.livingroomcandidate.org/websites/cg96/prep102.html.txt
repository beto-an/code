Just 3 months earlier, on April 8, 1965, Dole voted\n\r    against House passage of legislation creating the Medicare\n\r    program (HR 6675). Instead, Dole voted to recommit HR 6675 to\n\r    the Ways and Means Committee with instructions to substitute a\n\r    \"voluntary\" Medicare bill. During a 1995 speech to the American\n\r    Conservative Union, Dole bragged about this vote, saying, \"I\n\r    was there, fighting the fight, voting against Medicare -- one\n\r    of twelve, because we knew it wouldn't work in 1965.\" [CQ\n\r    Almanac, 1965, p. 252, 950, 982; Votes # 34, 35, 97; Dole ACU\n\r    Speech, 10/24/95]"
