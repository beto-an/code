There's probably not a family in this audience\n\r    tonight that hadn't had some problem at some time in juggling\n\r    the demands of school for your kids or health care for your\n\r    kids or just being with your kids and the responsibility to be\n\r    at work.

We\n\r    can't have a balanced budget if we cripple our ability to\n\r    protect our environment. We can't have a balanced budget if we\n\r    take unnecessary cuts in the Medicare program that aren't\n\r    necessary to save it. We can't have a balanced budget if you\n\r    walk away from our commitment to guaranteed medical care for\n\r    the elderly, for families with persons with disabilities in the\n\r    family, for pregnant women and for poor children. We've got to\n\r    go forward together. That's what that whole thing was all\n\r    about. (Applause.)"

What is the task of the next four years? We have our\n\r    economic house in order. We've got to make sure it's possible\n\r    for every single, solitary American to take part in this\n\r    economic recovery and to live out their dreams and to take care\n\r    of their families. That has to be our task for the next four\n\r    years. (Applause.)"

Characters:    "That means to me, among other things — I just want to\n\r    mention just a couple of things that I want to do in the next\n\r    four years. Number one, I want to make at least two years of\n\r    college as universal for Americans as a high school education\n\r    is today. (Applause.) Now, how do we propose to do that? By\n\r    giving a $10,000 tax deduction to families for the cost of\n\r    college tuition for any kind of education after high school and\n\r    — (applause) — a $1,500 refundable tax credit for the first two\n\r    years of college if that helps you more. That will get\n\r    everybody through a community college in any state in the\n\r    country just about. That's a good thing to do and we ought to\n\r    do it. (Applause.)"

Characters:    "Number two, I want to make sure that every child in every\n\r    school in America has the same chance everybody else does to\n\r    grow and learn, which means we not only need computers in every\n\r    school and classroom, and also trained teachers, but all those\n\r    classrooms need to be connected to this vast Information\n\r    Superhighway. That will give any child anywhere in America — in\n\r    the poorest inner-city neighborhood, in the most remote\n\r    mountain village — access to the same information that any\n\r    other child has anywhere in the world. We're going to connect\n\r    all those classrooms by the year 2000 if you'll let us do it.\n\r    (Applause.)"

Characters:    "And finally let me just say one word about health care. We\n\r    have done a good thing by saying you can't have your health\n\r    insurance taken away from you if you change jobs and you can't\n\r    be denied if you've got somebody in your family who is sick.\n\r    But we still have good, hard-working people who are unemployed\n\r    for longer periods than they used to be. I want to see us also\n\r    help those people who are unemployed who are dying to get back\n\r    in the work force keep their families in health insurance for\n\r    at least six more months. And that's a noble and good thing to\n\r    do. The kids need it. It will help them perform in school. It\n\r    will help the families stay together. It will make America\n\r    stronger. I hope you'll support it. (Applause.)"

Because we're\n\r    bringing the deficit down, because everybody knows we're going\n\r    toward a balanced budget your interest rates are lower. That's\n\r    lower mortgage payments, lower car payments, lower credit card\n\r    payments, more business investment and more jobs."

We can't jeopardize\n\r    that, but we can afford a family-friendly tax cut, a $500 tax\n\r    credit for children under 13, the education tax deductions that\n\r    I just mentioned, and an IRA available to families making up to\n\r    $80,000, moving up to $100,000 a year, that you can withdraw\n\r    from without any penalty to buy the first home, to deal with a\n\r    medical emergency and to educate your kids or yourselves. That\n\r    is a program we can afford and that's what we ought to have. It\n\r    will build America and balance the budget. (Applause.)"
