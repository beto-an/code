But all of you here know that our ability to\n\r    make America strong in the 21st century and to keep our people\n\r    living in the place of greatest possibility in the world is\n\r    clearly, clearly based on our ability to continue to make\n\r    progress in the environment."

Characters:    "As President I take no particular pleasure in exercising the\n\r    power of the veto. I like to get things done. I like to move\n\r    things forward. I like to work with people who have different\n\r    ideas in a positive way. But when it comes to protecting our\n\r    air, our food, our water, I cannot sacrifice America’s values\n\r    and America’s future, or America’s health and safety. It is\n\r    important to remember—let me say again, as so many have\n\r    said—that this current state of affairs that we have endured\n\r    for over a year now is a drastic aberration from the pattern of\n\r    a previous generation."

The natural blessings God gave this country were not\n\r    given to Democrats or Republicans because of their political\n\r    party. They were given to people who live on this particular\n\r    piece of God’s good earth, and we had better go back to\n\r    protecting them together. (Applause.)"

That is our fundamental obligation."
