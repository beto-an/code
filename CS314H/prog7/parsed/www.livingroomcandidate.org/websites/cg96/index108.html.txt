Characters:    "I have ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to give\n\r    local environmental information to communities, including\n\r    putting it on-line where it will be handy to computers, in one\n\r    place by the year 2000. So that a parent could go to the local\n\r    library or go to a school or just turn on a computer and\n\r    immediately find out the chemicals in your community to which\n\r    your children are exposed. That is a powerful early warning\n\r    system. And it will help grass-roots environmental activism\n\r    clean the environment even more. (Applause.)"

Characters:    "Finally, let me say, we have to take further steps to stop\n\r    toxics from getting into our drinking water. I signed an\n\r    executive order that directs every federal agency that's\n\r    appropriate to join in our effort to crack down on those who\n\r    would poison the waters and make them pay to clean it up. I\n\r    want to see to it that Congress fully funds the Safe Drinking\n\r    Water Act we just signed into law last month. (Applause.)"

But\n\r    I'll tell you, we've been given it; it's up to us to do the\n\r    right things with it."

That is the\n\r    direction we're going to take and that will keep us right on\n\r    track for the 21st century."
