Opposition to federal action against\n\r    domestic violence is not new to Bob Dole's 35 year\n\r    congressional career.

The act established a\n\r    $65 million grant program for state, local and private efforts\n\r    to prevent domestic violence and provide emergency shelter to\n\r    victims. Republican senators eventually killed the bill with a\n\r    threatened filibuster. [1980 CQ Almanac, p. 443-445, vote #382,\n\r    9/4/80; DPC, Senate Vote Report, 1980, vote # 390]"
