We made\n\r    it easier for people in small businesses to take out pensions\n\r    and to keep those pensions when they changed jobs. That's\n\r    terribly important. We made it easier for parents to adopt and\n\r    gave them a $5,000 tax credit if they would adopt a child that\n\r    needs a home, and removed the barriers to cross-racial adoption\n\r    because we want a pro-family country that takes care of every\n\r    child and finds a home for every child.

In 1994, our friends in the\n\r    opposition said, oh, look what the President did, they're going\n\r    to take your gun away from you. Guess what? Everybody in Ohio\n\r    is still hunting with the same gun they had when they said\n\r    that. It wasn't true then. (Applause.) And if you believed them\n\r    when they misled you, you need to pay them back this time and\n\r    tell them you don't appreciate being misled. You've still got\n\r    your gun, but the country is safer. (Applause.) I'll tell you\n\r    who doesn't have guns â€” 60, 000 felons, fugitives and stalkers\n\r    don't have guns because of the Brady Bill. (Applause.)"

It's all very well to say to people after a certain\n\r    time, we're going to cut you off welfare and make you go to\n\r    work â€” there has to be work to find. And I am going to the\n\r    convention to tell the American people what I propose to do to\n\r    help find jobs to move people from welfare to work and help\n\r    jobs for other people who are not yet there.

You just figure it out.
