This is not so.\r\n\rAlthough most economists concede that certain targeted cuts (such as\r\n\ra small reduction in the top marginal income tax rate or business tax\r\n\rincentives) might be largely self-financing, these cuts don't add up\r\n\rto a lot of money or growth.  More important, since they must be\r\n\rtargeted toward businesses and affluent households, neither the\r\n\rRepublicans nor the Democrats -- as a practical matter -- can propose\r\n\rthem without also offering a much larger cut to the broad middle\r\n\rclass.

No finagling with the tax code will make the workforce grow\r\n\ras fast as it once did.  The share of women in the work force is\r\n\runlikely to rise much higher.
