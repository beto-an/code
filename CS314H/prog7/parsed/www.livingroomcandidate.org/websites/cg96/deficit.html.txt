President Clinton has stressed fiscal responsibility as the key to economic growth and has more than fulfilled his promise to cut the deficit in half in his first term. The deficit has been cut by 63 percent, leading the way for economic expansion and growing consumer confidence.  Today, with the deficit reduced to $107 billion, America is on the right track towards a balanced budget and increased economic growth.\r\n\r\r\n\r"

That�s the lowest mortgage rate since 1971.  In all, the rate rollback allowed some 10 million homeowners to save as much as $25 billion by refinancing their loans, according to David Lereah, the chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.\"\r\n\r\r\n\r"
