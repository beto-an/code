Characters:    "Today is yet another anniversary of Bob Dole�s votes against America�s working families.  October 19, 1995, Bob Dole voted in committee to allow employers to raid their employees� pension funds.  Then, Bob Dole voted against requiring companies to include in their taxable income any of the pension fund they took out of the employee plan. [Senate Committee on Finance, Senate vote #8349, 10/19/95; Senate Committee on Finance, Senate vote #8336, 10/19/95]   One month later, Dole voted for the Dole-Gingrich budget which would have allowed companies to take $15 billion out of pension funds -- affecting nearly 4 million workers. [Congressional Quarterly, 11/25/95, p.3613, vote #584, 11/17/95; PBGC Facts Sheet, 4/96]\r\n\r\r\n\r\t"

Characters:    "Bob Dole says he \"understands the problems\" of working America.  Doesn�t he believe Americans need the security of their pensions?  Doesn�t Bob Dole recognize employees� rights as an issue?  Well, Bob Dole�s \"word is his bond\" and his vote is his record.  Bob Dole�s record does not support working Americans.\r\n\r\r\n\r\t\t\t\t\t\t"
