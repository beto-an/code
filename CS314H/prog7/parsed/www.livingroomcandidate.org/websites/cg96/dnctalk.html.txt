We need new laws to crack down on\n\r    money laundering and to prosecute and punish those who commit\n\r    violent acts against American citizens abroad; to add chemical\n\r    markers or taggents to gunpowder used in bombs so we can crack\n\r    the bomb makers; to extend the same power police now have\n\r    against organized crime to save lives by tapping all the phones\n\r    that terrorists use. Terrorists are as big a threat to our\n\r    future, perhaps bigger, than organized crime. Why should we\n\r    have two different standards for a common threat to the safety\n\r    of America and our children? (Applause.)"

But\n\r    there are times -- there are times when only America can make\n\r    the difference between war and peace, between freedom and\n\r    repression, between life and death. We cannot save all the\n\r    world's children, but we can save many of them. We cannot\n\r    become the world's policeman, but where our values and our\n\r    interests are at stake, and where we can make a difference, we\n\r    must act and we must lead. That is our job, and we are better,\n\r    stronger, and safer because we are doing it. (Applause.)"

I have spent so much of your time that you gave me\n\r    these last four years to be your President worrying about the\n\r    problems of Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda,\n\r    Burundi. What do these places have in common? People are\n\r    killing each other and butchering children because they are\n\r    different from one another. They share the same piece of land,\n\r    but they are different from one another -- they hate their\n\r    race, their tribe, their ethnic group, their religion."
