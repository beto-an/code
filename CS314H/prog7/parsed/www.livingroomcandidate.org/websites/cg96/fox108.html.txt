It�s\n\r    working. Wages are rising for the first time in a decade. We\n\r    have the lowest unemployment in 7 1/2 years. Ten and a half\n\r    million new jobs. A 60 percent cut in the deficit, lowering\n\r    interest rates on car loans, home mortgages, business loans. A\n\r    minimum wage increase for 10 million families."
