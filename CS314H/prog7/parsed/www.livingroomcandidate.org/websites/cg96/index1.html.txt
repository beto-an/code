One day, I went to hear the\n\r          President and Vice President speak at the National Rural\n\r          Conference at the Univeristy of Iowa. Once there, I found\n\r          that the two men I had only experienced through TV\n\r          screens and newspaper articles became real, living people\n\r          that cared deeply about rural America. I wrote up an\n\r          editorial which is posted on my web site, and also want\n\r          to share his story with Clinton/Gore supporters."

He chaired it\n\r          personally for over five hours and when his voice began\n\r          to fade, the Vice-President took over. The huge briefing\n\r          books set down by the aides for the President and\n\r          Vice-President were never opened. Both men carried on\n\r          extensive and complex discussions supported entirely by\n\r          the knowledge they carried in their heads.”"
