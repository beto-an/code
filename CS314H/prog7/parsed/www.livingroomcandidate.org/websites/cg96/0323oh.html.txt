And our great\n\r    challenge today is to take the positive things that have\n\r    happened, that Senator Glenn talked about, and build on them to\n\r    achieve our mission—to provide security to every working family\n\r    in this country that is willing to work for it, so that\n\r    everyone will be rewarded for what they do;—(applause)—and to\n\r    help our people in the great struggles of daily life, to\n\r    strengthen our families and give all of our kids a childhood,\n\r    to make all of our streets safe, and our environment clean.\n\r    That is our struggle.

No, I don’t pretend that we solved all the\n\r    problems, but we do have over 8 million new jobs, just like I\n\r    said; we have cut the deficit, just like I said; and wages are\n\r    going up again in America for the first time in a decade.

But let me\n\r    tell you, we are the world’s only superpower now. I try not to\n\r    meddle. There are some things we can’t do. I don’t want to be\n\r    the world’s policeman, but we can’t walk away. We have to try\n\r    to be the world’s peace-maker. And every time we make\n\r    peace—(applause)—every time we make peace for people in other\n\r    parts of the world we ensure that we will be a little\n\r    safer."

We saw it in Oklahoma City. And\n\r    when you see bombs blow up innocent civilians in Israel or in\n\r    London, just remember this: In the world we’re living in, with\n\r    computer technology, with open borders, one of our biggest\n\r    challenges is seeing the people who are terrorists, the people\n\r    who are drug runners, the people who are organized criminals,\n\r    and the people who smuggle weapons of mass destruction,\n\r    including chemical and biological weapons, coming together and\n\r    working together. I am determined that that will not happen,\n\r    and I intend to keep us involved with every freedom loving\n\r    country in the world that will stand up to the terrorists and\n\r    the thugs that would rob innocent people of their future.\n\r    (Applause.)"

I want a government that is smaller and\n\r    less bureaucratic. We have given you the smallest government,\n\r    not the other party that always cursed the federal government.\n\r    The Democrats have given you the smallest national government\n\r    in 30 years and the biggest reduction in regulations.\n\r    (Applause.)"

You look—I\n\r    want you to look at where the budget negotiations were when\n\r    they left them to go finish their campaign. They had\n\r    acknowledged that we didn’t need those big Medicare cuts, those\n\r    big Medicaid cuts; that we didn’t have to gut education or\n\r    environmental protection; that we didn’t have to raise taxes on\n\r    working people, we don’t have to raid pension funds, we don’t\n\r    have to do those things."

Characters:    "Now, remember this, there is no longer a choice between the\n\r    status quo and change. There are two real different views of\n\r    change here. They say the government is the problem, just get\n\r    out of the way and let things take their course. I say, you\n\r    remember what happened 100 years ago? The progressive movement\n\r    that culminated in Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John\n\r    Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson—that progressive movement started under\n\r    a Republican, Teddy Roosevelt. They abandoned him and his\n\r    tradition, and we shouldn’t make the same mistake. We have to\n\r    stand up for that. (Applause.)"
