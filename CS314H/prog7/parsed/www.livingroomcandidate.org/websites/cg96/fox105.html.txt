Last year, when Republicans in\n\r    Congress passed a plan that cut $270 billion from Medicare, I\n\r    vetoed it. When they shut the government down to force me to\n\r    sign it, I still said no. My balanced budget plan saves\n\r    Medicare instead of undermining it. We�ve also protected 40\n\r    million private pensions, and made pensions more portable and\n\r    available to small business people."
