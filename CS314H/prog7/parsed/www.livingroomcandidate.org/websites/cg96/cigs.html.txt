I notice that\n\r    Senator Dole questioned the other day whether or not tobacco\n\r    was really addictive for everybody. And then, apparently, this\n\r    morning, when it was -- he was asked about Dr. Koop, who was\n\r    President Reagan's Surgeon General, a remarkable man, who may\n\r    be a Republican for all I know -- President Reagan's Surgeon\n\r    General, but he has been one of our most outspoken advocates of\n\r    trying to stop smoking among young people -- and this morning\n\r    Senator Dole suggested that maybe Dr. Koop had been brainwashed\n\r    by the liberal media. Well, I imagine Dr. Koop was surprised to\n\r    hear that."
