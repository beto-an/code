Characters:    "When it comes to Bob Dole and Hollywood, its lights,\n\r    camera and no action. Since his speech in 1995, Senator Bob\n\r    Dole opposed all efforts to empower parents against the\n\r    negative influences from the entertainment industry. Bob Dole\n\r    opposed the V-chip in television sets that will allow parents\n\r    to protect their children from unsuitable television\n\r    programming. Bob Dole opposed a mandatory television ratings\n\r    system saying \"I did not suggest the government do anything\".\n\r    And Bob Dole refused to support President Clinton�s initiative\n\r    to ensure real educational programming is available to our\n\r    children."
