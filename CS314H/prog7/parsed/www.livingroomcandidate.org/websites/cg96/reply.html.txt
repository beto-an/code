(b) Most of the increased tax revenue from individuals reflects higher income, not higher tax rates.  (c) As a share of GDP, government now takes 40 cents on the dollar.  Rep. Susan Molinari used this figure in her Republican Convention keynote address to illustrate the burden of Clinton's tax increase.  But the increase in this figure is due entirely to the rise in state and local taxes.  As a share of GDP, federal taxes have been roughly stable under Clinon.\"\r\n\r"
