We've cleaned out more toxic waste dumps\n\r    in the last three years than in the previous 12. We passed a\n\r    Safe Drinking Water Act, a Pesticide Protection Act. We\n\r    upgraded the standards for safe meat and poultry. We're moving\n\r    in the right direction, but we have to do more. And I'll be\n\r    saying more about this later today, but we need to clean up at\n\r    least two-thirds of the toxic waste dumps in this country in\n\r    the next four years. We have delayed it long enough.\n\r    (Applause.)"

We will not be one community if in the name of\n\r    balancing the budget we give a tax cut that requires us to cut\n\r    Medicare, stop Medicaid's commitment to families with members\n\r    with disabilities."

We're going to spend more on\n\r    research, $1 billion more, because it's important. We have\n\r    doubled the life expectancy for people with AIDS or HIV\n\r    infection in just the last four years, doubled it because of\n\r    research. (Applause.) We may be able to extend their lives\n\r    indefinitely in good, quality ways because of research."

That is what we're getting out of research. (Applause.)\n\r    He's right. But he's also right when Christopher Reeve said to\n\r    me — and I thank these people here for coming to be with us\n\r    today — Christopher Reeve said, you know, you've got to make\n\r    that fight on Medicaid; you can't let them take away Medicaid\n\r    because not everybody who gets hurt like me has been an actor,\n\r    has made a good living; And even people like me can go broke.\n\r    Middle class families deserve the right to keep working and\n\r    caring for their family members.
