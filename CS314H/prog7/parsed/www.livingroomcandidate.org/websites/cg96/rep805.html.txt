It's a gamble we can't afford to take.  \r\n\rThe Dole economic plan would balloon the deficit, increase the debt and cripple the economy.  President Clinton,\r\n\r in addition to being the first President in over 150 years to cut the deficit for four years in a row, has proposed \r\n\rresponsible tax cuts for education, savings and children -- all paid for in his balanced budget.  President Clinton has \r\n\rchanged the country's course.  Bob Dole now wants to bet America's future.\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r"
