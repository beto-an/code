Characters:    "Another Bob Dole anniversary. Another Bob Dole vote\n\r    against the issues that matter most to Americans. In 1965, Bob\n\r    Dole voted against creating the Medicare program -- a program\n\r    which preserves health care benefits for 37 million elderly and\n\r    disabled Medicare beneficiaries. A year ago today, Bob Dole\n\r    bragged about that 1965 vote against Medicare saying, \"I was\n\r    there, fighting the fight, voting against Medicare -- one of\n\r    twelve -- because we knew it wouldn�t work in 1965.\""

And now\n\r    he has a risky $550 billion tax scheme that threatens even\n\r    deeper cuts in Medicare. Even his own campaign co-chair Al\n\r    D�Amato said that Dole would have \"to look at Medicare\" to pay\n\r    for his risky, budget scheme."
