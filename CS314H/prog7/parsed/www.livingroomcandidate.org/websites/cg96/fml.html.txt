Bob Dole twice voted to defeat\n\r    it, led the filibusters against it, and still opposes it today.\n\r    President Clinton has said Family Leave is one of the most\n\r    important acts of his Administration because it strengthens\n\r    working families. Bob Dole stated that Family and Medical Leave\n\r    had \"nothing to do with family values.\""
