Each of\n\r    President Clinton's annual budgets has contained significant\n\r    increases for the VA. For the 1997 fiscal year, the President\n\r    proposed a $1.3 billion increase for the VA above the amount\n\r    Congress appropriated for fiscal year 1996, more than half of\n\r    which would be directed toward veterans' health care and other\n\r    discretionary programs. In addition, the VA and other agencies\n\r    increasingly addressed the needs of the Persian Gulf War\n\r    veterans who have undiagnosed illnesses."
