Under 3 and 1/2 years of President\n\r    Clinton, the deficit has been cut by 60 percent. The\n\r    President's 1993 Economic Plan cut federal spending by $255\n\r    billion -- one of the largest spending cut packages in history.\n\r    Spending as a share of the economy has declined from 23.3% to\n\r    21.7% of GDP and is lower than at any time during the previous\n\r    two Administrations -- lower than any year since 1979. The\n\r    federal workforce has been reduced by nearly 250,000 workers to\n\r    its lowest level since President Kennedy."

When Bob Dole was a Republican Leader -- as Senate\n\r    Finance Committee Chairman and Senate Majority Leader -- from\n\r    1980 to 1986, the deficit tripled. Worse, his risky $548\n\r    billion economic scheme would blow a hole in the deficit and\n\r    actually raise taxes on nine million working\n\r    Americans."
