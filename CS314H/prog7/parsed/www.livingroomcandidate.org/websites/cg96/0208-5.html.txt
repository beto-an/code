And as I said, we doubled the SBA loan volume. And I\n\r    could give you a lot of other examples—but in the end, our\n\r    ability to succeed consistent in our ability to readjust. The\n\r    responsibilities of the national government with the states,\n\r    with the localities, with the private sector, with individuals,\n\r    and to build a new partnership for a new era."

(Laughter.) But a\n\r    big part of it is learning to work together in a way that is\n\r    affirmative, is positive, that lifts people up."

Your unemployment is\n\r    lower than ours. Your growth rate is higher. You have the\n\r    lowest deficit in the world of any advanced country. All the\n\r    rest of us look up to you."

Characters:    "Well, we have to pierce that cynicism, because cynicism in\n\r    the end is a lousy excuse for inaction. It’s a lousy\n\r    justification for failure. It’s a lousy explanation for\n\r    disappointment in life. And I am convinced that if we Democrats\n\r    go out there in 1996 with a common-sense, compassionate,\n\r    intense commitment to the family; to the work, to the future of\n\r    America; to the idea that the government can play a role as a\n\r    partner in creating opportunity, and people have to assume more\n\r    responsibility; and to an uncompromising position that we must\n\r    do this together—we have no intention of going back to the time\n\r    when people were left to fend for themselves, because we\n\r    believe the age of possibility is for all Americans—I believe\n\r    that our efforts will be rewarded. They must be rewarded in the\n\r    President’s race and the races for Congress and in the races\n\r    for the statehouses."
