I said we must not rest until\n\r    America has a national disability policy based on three simple\n\r    creeds: inclusion, not exclusion; independence, not dependence;\n\r    and empowerment, not paternalism. I remain committed to that\n\r    vision.\" President William J. Clinton, May 23, 1996."
