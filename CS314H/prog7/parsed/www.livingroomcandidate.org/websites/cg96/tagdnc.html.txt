(Shouts of\n\r    greeting from the audience.) It's great to see you --\n\r    (chuckling) -- great to see you. Mr. Chairman and delegates,\n\r    and fellow Democrats and fellow Americans, tonight I would like\n\r    to talk with you about a civil society, the kind of society\n\r    that I want my four children to live in, the kind of society\n\r    that you and I are working to build. A civil society is built\n\r    by the smallest, simplest gestures, things that we do every day\n\r    without thinking twice about them."

Characters:    "Seventy-six years ago, Mrs. Byrne, from the -- east\n\r    Tennessee, did such a thing. Women's suffrage had come down to\n\r    one vote, and her son, Harry, a 24-year-old Tennessee state\n\r    representative, was expected to vote no. But then Mrs. Byrne\n\r    wrote a letter. It said, \"Be a good boy, Harry, and do the\n\r    right thing.\" (Cheers, applause.) Yes. He switched. He switched\n\r    from no to yes, and that's how the 19th Amendment was ratified\n\r    to give women the right to vote. Right. (Cheers, applause.)"

As you know, I began\n\r    a difficult fight, long before it became fashionable, to give\n\r    parents the tools to protect their children from violence and\n\r    obscenity and the degradation of women. We won voluntary\n\r    labeling of records and CDs. And today, parents have a more\n\r    powerful tool to ensure that their values will not be\n\r    undermined. Then, the battle was music."

That's -- (applause) --\n\r    that's one way in which President Clinton and Vice President\n\r    Gore are shifting the balance of power back to America's\n\r    families."

For\n\r    too long, diseases of the brain have had second-class status.\n\r    But President Clinton has fought alongside compassionate\n\r    members of Congress for equal insurance coverage for mental\n\r    health. And to change -- (applause) -- and he's worked to\n\r    change the lives and the outlook of families living with mental\n\r    illness."
