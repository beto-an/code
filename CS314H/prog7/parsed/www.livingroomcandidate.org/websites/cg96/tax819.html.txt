Start element: P
Characters:    "Today, the Dole campaign responded to the charge that Dole has voted to raise taxes and fees over 450 times during \r\n\rhis career.  Interestingly, the Dole campaign did not dispute the fundamental truth -- that Dole has indeed voted to increase \r\n\rtaxes and fees at least 450 times in his career.  As Bob Dole once said, \"Facts can be stubborn things.\" This 450 number \r\n\rwas achieved using an extremely conservative methodology.  If Dole�s own methodology were used, then Dole voted to \r\n\rincrease at least 887 separate taxes and fees. If the Dole campaign wants to credibly continue this debate, they need to answer \r\n\ra few questions:   \r\n\r\r\n\r"

Characters:    "3.\tIs it or is it not true that using a conservative methodology, Bob Dole has voted to raise 450 taxes and fees during his 35-year career in Congress?   Using a more aggressive approach -- counting multiple tax/fee provisions listed in the same Congressional Quarterly paragraph -- Dole has voted for at least 887 tax and fee hikes.  And using the same methodology as the Dole for President campaign -- including proposed tax hikes -- the number would certainly be in the thousands.\r\n\r\r\n\r"

The day before the 1982 tax increase was passed, Dole said,  \"There is no doubt in my mind it is going to be a good bipartisan package....Last year, the tax cut was too big, and this year the increase is too small\"�  (Congressional Record, S-21869, 1982.)\r\n\r\r\n\r"
