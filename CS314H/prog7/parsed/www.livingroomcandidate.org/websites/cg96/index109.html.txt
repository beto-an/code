If you watch our convention, you know there's a lot\n\r    of discussion about the welfare reform bill that I signed.

We're going to have a national program that\n\r    guarantees child care so when people go to work, even if\n\r    they're in lower-wage jobs — from welfare to work — they won't\n\r    have to worry about their kids.

Now, when you make this decision for\n\r    governor, there will be no question more important than, who do\n\r    you trust to really care about giving the people who have been\n\r    trapped on welfare the same kind of life we want for all\n\r    American families. We want people to succeed as parents and\n\r    succeed as workers. Frank O'Bannon will do that, and I want you\n\r    to give him the chance to do it. (Applause.)"

I couldn't believe we quadrupled the\n\r    debt of this country in just 12 years. I want you to know that\n\r    tonight not only have we cut the deficit by 60 percent, your\n\r    budget would have a surplus tonight if it weren't for the\n\r    interest we pay on the debt run up in the 12 years before I\n\r    became President.

If you bring the deficit down the way we have,\n\r    that brings interest rates down. What does that mean when\n\r    interest rates come down? It means your house payment, your car\n\r    payment, your credit card payment goes down. Even more\n\r    important, maybe, it means business people can go borrow money,\n\r    invest it in businesses, and create new jobs.
