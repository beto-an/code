Upon leaving the Senate this\n\r    year, Bob Dole remarked that \"I'm not going to stay until\n\r    Wednesday\" (one extra day before his retirement) to pass the\n\r    Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill that made it possible\n\r    for 25 million Americans to have better health care coverage.\n\r    President Clinton was only able to get the health care reform\n\r    bill passed once Bob Dole left the Senate. And if President\n\r    Clinton had not blocked the 1995 Dole/Gingrich budget, Medicaid\n\r    would have been cut $163 billion and Medicare would have been\n\r    cut by $270 billion -- the largest cuts in history."
