Before I make this unveiling official, I want to thank\n\r    Peter Knight for his leadership on the Clinton/Gore '96\n\r    campaign. As some of you know Peter and I have been close\n\r    friends for more than 20 years and it is a great pleasure to be\n\r    able to work with him in this capacity."

We believe that\n\r    technology opens doors, creates jobs, and makes possible the\n\r    opportunity for all of our citizens to reach out for the\n\r    American dream.

Since 1992, Bill Clinton has been\n\r    working tirelessly to insure that America forges ahead and\n\r    leads the world in the information age. He has brought\n\r    technology into our classrooms and libraries, he signed the\n\r    historic telecommunications reform bill to make sure that all\n\r    of our cabinet agencies are online. Together, not long after we\n\r    got into the White House, we became the very first President\n\r    and Vice-President to have e-mail addresses and to set up a\n\r    White House Website. I hope all of you have had the opportunity\n\r    to visit the White House Website."

It was apparently about the assault weapons ban --\n\r    those three words were contiguous to one another in the Dole\n\r    statement -- but various people have scratched their heads and\n\r    tried with great difficulty to decipher what he was trying to\n\r    say."

It's\n\r    important to have direct access -- see for yourself -- but\n\r    Senator Dole is wrong on the assault weapons ban, he was wrong\n\r    when he filibustered the ban, he was wrong when he sponsored an\n\r    amendment that blocked the assault weapons ban, he was wrong\n\r    when he worked so hard to repeal the assault weapons ban, and\n\r    made it a priority to repeal it, and he is just as wrong --\n\r    dead wrong -- today, when he says that the ban is irrelevant.\n\r    Senator Dole thinks it's enough just to keep these deadly\n\r    weapons away from felons. President Clinton thinks we should\n\r    keep them off our streets, period. There's no room for weapons\n\r    that are only meant to kill and maim people in\n\r    America."

This is what would have happened to the deficit if\n\r    President Clinton's economic plan had not passed -- the red\n\r    line -- and the blue line shows what has actually happened\n\r    during President Clinton's first four years here and what will\n\r    happen under the President's 1997 budget plan -- bringing our\n\r    budget into balance a few years hence."

Well, Bob Dole claiming that Bill Clinton has not done\n\r    anything is about as far out as that movie \"Independence Day\".\n\r    As what Senator Dole said was science fiction, here is the\n\r    science -- again, one click of the mouse proves the elephant's\n\r    wrong."

The President has granted more waivers than the\n\r    two previous Administrations combined. These waivers cover more\n\r    than 10 million people -- about 75% of all recipients of AFDC.\n\r    President Clinton's reforms have helped reduce the food stamp\n\r    roll, saving 1.3 billion dollars. And today, as a result of\n\r    Bill Clinton's emphasis on welfare reform, welfare rolls have\n\r    decreased by 1.3 million, almost 10% -- a reduction of 10% in\n\r    the welfare rolls since we took office. That's why people are\n\r    calling it real reform -- a quiet revolution that's putting\n\r    people back to work. That's what President Clinton is\n\r    doing."
