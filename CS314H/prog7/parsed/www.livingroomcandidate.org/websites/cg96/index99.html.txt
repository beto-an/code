It has not\n\r    imposed undue inconvenience on anybody. It has made our law\n\r    enforcement officials safer. And it has made our citizens\n\r    safer. It covers today anyone convicted of a felony. The\n\r    problem is there is one class of misdemeanors that tend to be\n\r    particularly violent, where we know there's a potential for\n\r    future violence, where often there's a plea bargain which goes\n\r    from a felony to a misdemeanor. And that is the painful area of\n\r    domestic violence. I believe that the Brady Bill should cover\n\r    anybody with a domestic violence conviction.

If you're convicted of a felony, you shouldn't have one.\n\r    If you're a fugitive from the law, you shouldn't have a gun. If\n\r    you're stalking or harassing women or children, you shouldn't\n\r    have a gun. And if you commit an act of violence against your\n\r    spouse or your child, you shouldn't have a gun.

In early 1992, about four and\n\r    a half years ago, just before the New Hampshire primary, I had\n\r    a fundraiser scheduled in a big hotel in New York. And,\n\r    frankly, I was having a tough time. I was dropping in the polls\n\r    and all the press had said I was dead and over, history,\n\r    finished. I was feeling pretty sorry for myself. All I was\n\r    thinking about was my politics. I'm ashamed to say it, but\n\r    that's all I was thinking about."

And I'm kind of looking\n\r    down and just feeling sorry for myself. It was pitiful.\n\r    (Laughter.) And Dimitrios was working in that hotel, in his\n\r    uniform."

My 10-year-old boy — his son was\n\r    10 then — he says, my 10-year-old boy, he studies this election\n\r    in school and he says I should vote for you. He said, but if I\n\r    vote for you, I want you to do something for me. I said, what.\n\r    He said, I want you to make my son free."

I'm working hard, I have more\n\r    money, but we're not free. He said, just across the street from\n\r    my apartment there is a park, but my son can't play in it\n\r    unless I'm there with him. He has a school only two blocks from\n\r    our home, but my son can't walk there unless I go with him. So\n\r    if I do what my son wants me to do, I want you to make my boy\n\r    free."
