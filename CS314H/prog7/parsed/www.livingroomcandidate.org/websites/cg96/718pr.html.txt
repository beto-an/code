Last\n\r    year, Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich passed the most anti-education\n\r    budget in American history cutting $31 billion in funding for\n\r    public education. Today, Bob Dole said he wants to take another\n\r    $15 billion from public education. Bob Dole is using teacher\n\r    bashing as a smoke screen in another attempt to siphon funds\n\r    from public education."

As part of his 1993 proposal to re-authorize the\n\r    Elementary and Secondary Education Act, President Clinton\n\r    proposed providing start-up funds for teachers, parents, and\n\r    others to start charter schools -- innovative public schools\n\r    governed by teachers, parents and others that operate free of\n\r    many district and state regulations but are held accountable\n\r    for results through performance-based contracts. In 1995,\n\r    President Clinton announced grants to provide start-up funds\n\r    for Charter Schools in 11 states, including Minnesota,\n\r    Michigan, California, Texas, and Massachusetts."
