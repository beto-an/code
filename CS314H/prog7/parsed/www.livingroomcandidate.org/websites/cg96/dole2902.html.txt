Characters:    "In St. Louis, Bob Dole challenged the American people to\n\r    \"trust, but verify.\" Senator Dole's record verifies that he\n\r    would cut Medicare to pay for his risky $550 billion tax cut\n\r    scheme. In 1965, Senator Dole voted against the creation of\n\r    Medicare. Just last year, Dole and Gingrich tried to make\n\r    record cuts of $270 billion in Medicare. If Senator Dole wants\n\r    the American people to trust him, he should tell the truth\n\r    about what he will cut to pay for his tax cut campaign promise.\n\r    You can trust Senator Dole to cut Medicare and verify it with\n\r    his record."
