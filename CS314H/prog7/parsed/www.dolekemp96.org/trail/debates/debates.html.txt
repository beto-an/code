We have\n\r  defeated, in this system of ours, fascism, Naziism, communism,\n\r  socialism is defunct or debunked around the world, the evil of\n\r  apartheid has ended. There's only one last question remaining for\n\r  the next century, indeed, the next millennium - Can we in America\n\r  make the world's greatest liberal democracy, this democratic\n\r  experiment in private property, limited government, the rule of\n\r  law, respect for families and traditional Judeo-Christian values\n\r  work so it can be a blessing to our country and a blessing to the\n\r  rest of the world?"
