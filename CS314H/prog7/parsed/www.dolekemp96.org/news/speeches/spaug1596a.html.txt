Characters:    "\n\r    And I am profoundly moved by your confidence and trust, and I\n\r    look forward to leading America into the next century. But this\n\r    is not my moment, it is yours. It is yours, Elizabeth. It is\n\r    yours, Robin. It is yours, Jack and Joanne Kemp."

Characters:    "\n\r    And do not think I have forgotten whose moment this is above\n\r    all. It is for the people of America that I stand here tonight,\n\r    and by their generous leave. And as my voice echoes across\n\r    darkness and desert, as it is heard over car radios on coastal\n\r    roads, and as it travels above farmland and suburb, deep into\n\r    the heart of cities that, from space, look tonight like strings\n\r    of sparkling diamonds, I can tell you that I know whose moment\n\r    this is: It is yours.

Characters:    "\n\r    I was born in Russell, Kansas, a small town in the middle of\n\r    the prairie surrounded by wheat and oil wells. As my neighbors\n\r    and friends from Russell, who tonight sit in front of this\n\r    hall, know well, Russell, though not the West, looks out upon\n\r    the West."

Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And the first thing you learn on the prairie is the relative\n\r    size of a man compared to the lay of the land. And under the\n\r    immense sky where I was born and raised, a man is very small,\n\r    and if he thinks otherwise, he is wrong."
Characters:    "\n\r    I come from good people, very good people, and I'm proud of it.\n\r    My father's name was Doran and my mother's name was Bina. I\n\r    loved them and there's no moment when my memory of them and my\n\r    love for them does not overshadow anything I do -- even this,\n\r    even here -- and there is no height to which I have risen that\n\r    is high enough to allow me to allow me to forget them -- to\n\r    allow me to forget where I came from, and where I stand and how\n\r    I stand -- with my feet on the ground, just a man at the mercy\n\r    of God."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And this perspective has been strengthened and solidified by a\n\r    certain wisdom that I owe not to any achievement of my own, but\n\r    to the gracious compensations of age."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Now I know that in some quarters I may not -- may be expected\n\r    to run from this, the truth of this, but I was born in 1923,\n\r    and facts are better than dreams and good presidents and good\n\r    candidates don't run from the truth."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    I do not need the presidency to make or refresh my soul. That\n\r    false hope I will gladly leave to others.

Characters:    "\n\r    And to those who say it was never so, that America's not been\n\r    better, I say you're wrong. And I know because I was there. And\n\r    I have seen it. And I remember."

Characters:    "\n\r    And our nation, though wounded and scathed, has outlasted\n\r    revolutions, civil war, world war, racial oppression and\n\r    economic catastrophe. We have fought and prevailed on almost\n\r    every continent. And in almost every sea."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    We have even lost. But we have lasted, and we have always come\n\r    through."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And what enabled us to accomplish this has little to do with\n\r    the values of the present. After decades of assault upon what\n\r    made America great, upon supposedly obsolete values, what have\n\r    we reaped? What have we created? What do we have?"
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    What we have in the opinions of millions of Americans is crime\n\r    and drugs, illegitimacy, abortion, the abdication of duty, and\n\r    the abandonment of children."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And after the virtual devastation of the American family, the\n\r    rock upon which this country was founded, we are told that it\n\r    takes a village, that is collective, and thus the state, to\n\r    raise a child."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    The state is now more involved than it ever has been in the\n\r    raising of children. And children are now more neglected, more\n\r    abused and more mistreated than they have been in our time."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    This is not a coincidence. This is not a coincidence. And with\n\r    all due respect, I am here to tell you it does not take a\n\r    village to raise a child. It takes a family to raise a\n\r    child."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    If I could by magic restore to every child who lacks a father\n\r    or a mother that father or that mother, I would. And though I\n\r    cannot, I would never turn my back on them. And I shall as\n\r    President vote measures that keep families whole."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And I'm here to tell you that permissive and destructive\n\r    behavior must be opposed. That honor and liberty must be\n\r    restored and that individual accountability must replace\n\r    collective excuse."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And I'm here to say I am here to say to America, do not abandon\n\r    the great traditions that stretch to the dawn of our history.\n\r    Do not topple the pillars of those beliefs -- God, family,\n\r    honor, duty, country -- that have brought us through time, and\n\r    time, and time, and time again."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And to those who believe that I am too combative, I say if I am\n\r    combative, it is for love of country. It is to uphold a\n\r    standard that I was I was born and bread to defend. And to\n\r    those who believe that I live and breathe compromise, I say\n\r    that in politics honorable compromise is no sin. It is what\n\r    protects us from absolutism and intolerance."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    But one must never compromise in regard to God and family and\n\r    honor and duty and country. And I'm here to set a marker, that\n\r    all may know that it is possible to rise in politics, with\n\r    these things firmly in mind, not compromised and never\n\r    abandoned, never abandoned."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    For the old values endure and though they may sleep and though\n\r    they may falter, they endure. I know this is true. And to\n\r    anyone who believes that restraint honor and trust in the\n\r    people cannot be returned to government, I say follow me,\n\r    follow me."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Only right conduct, only right conduct distinguishes a great\n\r    nation from one that cannot rise above itself. It has never\n\r    been otherwise."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Right conduct every day, at every level, in all facets of life.\n\r    The decision of a child not to use drugs; of a student not to\n\r    cheat; of a young woman or a young man to serve when called; of\n\r    a screenwriter to refuse to add to mountains of trash; of a\n\r    businessman not to bribe; of a politician to cast a vote or\n\r    take action that will put his office or his chances of victory\n\r    at risk, but which is right."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And why have so many of us -- and I do not exclude myself, for\n\r    I am not the model of perfection -- why have so many of us been\n\r    failing these tests for so long? The answer is not a mystery.\n\r    It is to the contrary quite simple and can be given quite\n\r    simply."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    It is because for too long we have had a leadership that has\n\r    been unwilling to risk the truth, to speak without calculation,\n\r    to sacrifice itself."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    An administration, in its very existence, communicates this day\n\r    by day until it flows down like rain and the rain becomes a\n\r    river and the river becomes a flood."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Which is more important, wealth or honor?"
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    It is not as was said by the victors four years ago, the\n\r    economy stupid. It's a kind of nation we are. It's whether we\n\r    still possess the wit and determination to deal with many\n\r    questions including economic questions, but certainly not\n\r    limited to them. All things do not flow from wealth or poverty.\n\r    I know this firsthand and so do you."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    All things flow from doing what is right."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    The cry of this nation lies not in its material wealth but in\n\r    courage, and sacrifice and honor. We tend to forget when\n\r    leaders forget. And we tend to remember it when they remember\n\r    it."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    The high office of the presidency requires not a continuous\n\r    four year campaign for re-election, but rather broad oversight\n\r    and attention to three essential areas: the material, the moral\n\r    and the nation's survival in that ascending order of\n\r    importance."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    In the last presidential election, you the people were gravely\n\r    insulted. You were told that the material was not only the most\n\r    important of these three, but in fact, really the only one that\n\r    mattered."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    I don't hold to that for a moment. No one can deny the\n\r    importance of material well-being. And in this regard, it is\n\r    time to recognize we have surrendered too much of our economic\n\r    liberty. I do not appreciate the value of economic liberty\n\r    nearly as much for what it has done in keeping us fed, as to\n\r    what it's done in keeping us free."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    The freedom of the marketplace is not merely the best guarantor\n\r    of our prosperity. It is the chief guarantor of our rights, and\n\r    a government that seizes control of the economy for the good of\n\r    the people ends up seizing control of the people for the good\n\r    of the economy."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And our opponents portray the right to enjoy the fruits of\n\r    one's own time and labor as a kind selfishness against which\n\r    they must fight for the good of the nation. But they are deeply\n\r    mistaken, for when they gather to themselves the authority to\n\r    take the earnings and direct the activities of the people, they\n\r    are fighting not for our sake but for the power to tell us what\n\r    to do."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And you now work from the first of January to May just to pay\n\r    your taxes so that the party of government can satisfy its\n\r    priorities with the sweat of your brow because they think that\n\r    what you would do with your own money would be morally and\n\r    practically less admirable than what they would do with it."
Characters:    "\n\r    And that simply has got to stop. It's got to stop in\n\r    America."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    It is demeaning to the nation that within the Clinton\n\r    administration, a core of the elite who never grew up, never\n\r    did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and never\n\r    learned, should have the power to fund with your earnings their\n\r    dubious and self-serving schemes."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Somewhere, a grandmother couldn't afford to call her\n\r    granddaughter, or a child went without a book, or a family\n\r    couldn't afford that first home because there was just not\n\r    enough money to make the call, or to buy the book, or to pay\n\r    the mortgage. Or, for that matter, to do many other things that\n\r    one has the right and often the obligation to do."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Why? Because some genius in the Clinton administration took the\n\r    money to fund yet another theory, yet another program and yet\n\r    another bureaucracy. Are they taking care of you, or are they\n\r    taking care of themselves?"
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    I have asked myself that question. And I say, let the people be\n\r    free. Free to keep. Let the people be free to keep as much of\n\r    what they earn as the government can strain with all its might\n\r    not to take, not the other way around."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    I trust the American people to work in the best interest of the\n\r    people. And I believe that every family, wage earner and small\n\r    business in America can do better -- if only we have the right\n\r    policies in Washington, D.C."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And make no mistake about it, my economic program is the right\n\r    policy for America and for the future, and for the next\n\r    century."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Here's what it will mean to you. Here's what it will mean to\n\r    you. It means you will have a president who will urge Congress\n\r    to pass and send to the states for ratification a balanced\n\r    budget amendment to the Constitution."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    It means you will have a president and a Congress who have the\n\r    will to balance the budget by the year 2002. It means you will\n\r    have a president who will reduce taxes 15 percent\n\r    across-the-board for every taxpayer in America."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And it will include a $500 per child tax credit for lower and\n\r    middle income families in America. Taxes for a family of four\n\r    making $35,000 a year would be reduced by more than half -- 56\n\r    percent to be exact. And that's a big, big reduction."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    It means you will have a president who will help small\n\r    businesses, the businesses that create most new jobs, by\n\r    reducing the capital gains tax rate by 50 percent. Cut it in\n\r    half. It means you will have a president who will end the IRS\n\r    as we know it."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    It means you will have a president who will expand individual\n\r    retirement accounts, repeal President Clinton's Social Security\n\r    tax increase, provide estate tax relief, reduce government\n\r    regulations, reform our civil justice system, provide\n\r    educational opportunity scholarships and a host of other\n\r    proposals that will create more opportunity for all Americans\n\r    and all across America."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And I will not stop there. Working with Jack Kemp and a\n\r    Republican Congress I will not be satisfied until we have\n\r    reformed our entire tax code and made it fairer and flatter and\n\r    simpler for the American people."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    The principle involved here is time-honored and true, and that\n\r    is, it's your money. You shouldn't have to apologize for\n\r    wanting to keep what you earn. To the contrary, the government\n\r    should apologize for taking too much of it."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    The Clinton administration -- the Clinton administration just\n\r    doesn't get it. And that's why they have got to go."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    The president -- the president's content with the way things\n\r    are. I am not. We must commit ourselves to a far more ambitious\n\r    path that puts growth, expanding opportunities, rising incomes\n\r    and soaring prosperity at the heart of national policy."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    We must also commit ourselves to a trade policy that does not\n\r    suppress pay and threaten American jobs. And by any measure,\n\r    the trade policies of the Clinton administration has been a\n\r    disaster. Trade deficits are skyrocketing and middle income\n\r    families are paying the price."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    My administration will fully enforce our trade laws and not let\n\r    our national sovereignty be infringed by the World Trade\n\r    Organization or any other international body."

Characters:    "\n\r    Jack Kemp and I will restore the promise of America and get the\n\r    economy moving again, and we'll do so without leaving anybody\n\r    behind."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And I have learned in my own life, from my own experience that\n\r    not every man, woman or child can make it on their own. And\n\r    that in time of need, the bridge between failure and success\n\r    can be the government itself. And given all that I have\n\r    experienced, I shall always remember those in need. That is why\n\r    I helped to save Social Security in 1983 and that is why I will\n\r    be, I will be the president who preserves and strengthens and\n\r    protects Medicare for America's senior citizens."

Characters:    "\n\r    For I will never forget the man who rode on a train from Kansas\n\r    to Michigan to see his son who was thought to be dying in an\n\r    Army hospital.

Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    But the question of immigration is broader than that, and let\n\r    me specific. A family from Mexico arrives this morning legally\n\r    has as much right to the American Dream as the direct descents\n\r    of the Founding Fathers."
