Characters:    "\n\r    As I said in Russell, Kansas, Bob Dole's hometown, last\n\r    Saturday, we're going to take our cause from the boroughs of\n\r    New York to the barrios of California. We're not going to leave\n\r    anyone out of this cause and this campaign."

Characters:    "\n\r    And so, in the spirit of Mr. Lincoln, who believed that the\n\r    purpose of a great party was not to defeat the other party. The\n\r    purpose of a truly great party is to provide superior ideas,\n\r    principled leadership and a compelling cause, and in that\n\r    spirit, I accept your nomination for the Vice Presidency of the\n\r    United States of America."

Characters:    "\n\r    This is a great nation with a great mission, and last night we\n\r    nominated a leader whose stature is equal to that calling, a\n\r    man whose words convey a quiet strength, who knows what it\n\r    means to sacrifice for others, to sacrifice for his country,\n\r    and to demonstrate courage under fire; who brings together all\n\r    parties and backgrounds in a common cause."

Only democracy has\n\r    shown itself true to the hopes of all mankind. We must be that\n\r    party"
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    You see, democratic capitalism is not just the hope of wealth,\n\r    but it's the hope of justice.

Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    You see, the Creator of All has planted the seed of creativity\n\r    in every single one of us, the desire within every child of God\n\r    to work and build and improve our lot in life, and that of our\n\r    families and those we love. And in our work, and in the act of\n\r    creating that is part of all labor, we discover that part\n\r    within ourselves that is divine. I believe the ultimate\n\r    imperative for growth and opportunity is to advance human\n\r    dignity."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Dr. Martin Luther King believed that we must see a sleeping\n\r    hero in every soul. I belive America must establish policies\n\r    that summon those heroes and call forth their boundless\n\r    potential and that of the human spirit. But our fullest\n\r    potential will never be achieved by following leaders who call\n\r    us to timid tasks, diminished dreams and some era of\n\r    limits."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    You see, every generation faces a choice: hope or despair -- to\n\r    plan for scarcity or to embrace the possibilities. Societies\n\r    throughout history believed they had reached the frontiers of\n\r    human accomplishment. But in every age, those who trusted that\n\r    divine spark of imagination discovered that vastly greater\n\r    horizons still lay ahead."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    You see, Americans do not accept limits. We transcended those\n\r    limits. We do not settle for things as they are. We are intent\n\r    on succeeding."

Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    My daddy was a truck driver. He and my uncle bought the truck,\n\r    started a trucking company, put four boys through college. From\n\r    them and my mom, a teacher, I learned to never give up. Now I\n\r    want you to know tonight, from the bottom of my heart, to me,\n\r    faith, freedom and family, as well as life, are the greatest\n\r    gifts of God to all humanity. It is precious and we need to be\n\r    that party."

Characters:    "\n\r    Today America is on the threshold of the greatest period of\n\r    economic activity, technological development and\n\r    entrepreneurial adventure in the history of the world. We have\n\r    before us tomorrows that are even more thrilling than our more\n\r    glorious of yesterdays."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And yet the genius of the American people is being stifled. Our\n\r    economy is growing at the slowest pace in any recovery in this\n\r    century. The income of working men and woman in America is\n\r    dropping or stagnant. And there's kind of a gnawing feeling\n\r    throughout our nation that -- in some way, for some reason --\n\r    just something wrong."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Our friends in the other party say the economy is great. It's\n\r    moving forward. It's moving, like a ship dragging an anchor,\n\r    the anchor of taxes, and excessive regulations and big\n\r    government and bureaucracy."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    They say it's the best we do and the best we can hope for. But\n\r    that's because they have put their entire trust in government\n\r    rather than people. They want a government that runs our lives,\n\r    runs our businesses, runs our schools. You see, they just don't\n\r    believe in the unlimited possibilities that freedom can\n\r    bring."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Today, the Democratic Party is not democratic. They are\n\r    elitist. They don't have faith in people. They have in\n\r    government. They trust government more than markets. And that's\n\r    why they raised taxes on middle income families. That's why\n\r    they tried to nationalize health care. That's why that today\n\r    they say they are \"unalterably opposed\" to cutting taxes on the\n\r    American family."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    That's the problem with elitists -- they think they know better\n\r    than the people. But the truth is, there's a wisdom, there's an\n\r    intelligence in ordinary women and men far superior to the\n\r    greatest so-called experts that have every lived. That's what\n\r    our party must be all about."
Characters:    "\n\r    The Democratic Party is the party of the status quo. And as of\n\r    tonight, with Bob Dole as our leader, we are the party of\n\r    change."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Our first step will be to balance the budget with a strategy\n\r    that combines economy in government with the type of tax cuts\n\r    designed to liberate the productive genius of the American\n\r    people."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Now, of course, the naysayers in the Clinton White House say it\n\r    can't be done. They've got to say that. They don't know Bob\n\r    Dole and they don't know Jack Kemp."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    As Bob and I have said before and will continue to say\n\r    throughout this campaign, with a pro-growth Republican\n\r    Congress, balancing the budget while cutting taxes is just a\n\r    matter of presidential will. If you have it, you can do it. Bob\n\r    Dole has it. And Bob Dole will do it."

Characters:    "\n\r    We're going to start with a 15 percent across-the-board tax\n\r    rate cut. There's going to be tax relief and a $500 per child\n\r    tax credit. We're going to cut the capital gains tax in half,\n\r    and not apologize for it."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    We're going to take the side of the worker, the side of the\n\r    saver, the entrepreneur, the family.

Characters:    "\n\r    Here we are, on the eve of the 21st century, in the middle of\n\r    that technological revolution that is transforming the world in\n\r    which we live. But how can it be that so many families find\n\r    themselves struggling just to keep even, or just to get by?"
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    And I want to say this from the heart -- that as long as it\n\r    takes two earners to do what one earner used to do, how can\n\r    anybody say this economy is good enough for the American\n\r    people?"
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    Our tax cut will mean that parents will have more time to spend\n\r    with their children -- and with each other. It means that a\n\r    working parent can afford to take a job that lets them maybe be\n\r    home when the kids come home from school. It means that the\n\r    struggling, single mother in the inner city of America will\n\r    find it easier to get out of poverty and to work off the\n\r    welfare system which is a drag on her hopes and\n\r    aspirations."
Characters:    "\n\r    "

Characters:    "\n\r    The American society as a whole can never achieve the outer-\n\r    reaches of its potential so long as it tolerates the inner\n\r    cities of despair. And I can tell you that Bob Dole and Jack\n\r    Kemp will not tolerate that despair in our nation's cities."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    I read the account by a reporter -- I read the report -- when I\n\r    was at Housing and Urban Development, I read the account of a\n\r    reporter of his conversation with a 10-year-old child at Henry\n\r    Horner public housing in Chicago, which I had had the honor of\n\r    visiting."
Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    The reporter told in his book that he asked the little boy what\n\r    he wanted to be when he grew up. The little boy said, \"If I\n\r    grow up, I'd like to be a bus driver.\""
Characters:    "\n\r    "

Characters:    "\n\r    "
Characters:    "\n\r    My friends, we are a nation of immigrants. And as the former\n\r    president of Notre Dame University, Father Theodore Hesburgh,\n\r    said, the reason we have to close the back door of illegal\n\r    immigration is so that we can keep open the front door of legal\n\r    immigration."

Characters:    "\n\r    "
