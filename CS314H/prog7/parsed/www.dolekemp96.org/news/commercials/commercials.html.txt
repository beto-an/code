In an era of too much\n\r    salesmanship and too much smooth talking, Bob Dole is a\n\r    plain-spoken man. It was here that Bob Dole first developed\n\r    strength of character and strong values. I remember in our\n\r    household when you didn't tell the truth my mother she would,\n\r    well she would find a bar of soap. He put aside his dream of\n\r    becoming a doctor and, instead, answered his country's call to\n\r    duty... and was severely wounded. It was about 11 months I\n\r    think before I could feed myself... The fact that I've had a\n\r    problem, a serious problem, and I didn't give up, and I\n\r    overcame it and I was successful. Bob Dole knows what it takes\n\r    to help Americans fight back. You've got to challenge young\n\r    people. They've gotta learn from failure. There is a moral\n\r    crisis in America. Drug use is up. The wrong messages are being\n\r    sent to our youth. Americans do have a stake in this election.\n\r    It's about our America. It's not my America. It's your America.\n\r    It's what do I want for my kids. I want young people to have\n\r    the same challenges and the same opportunities, and succeed as\n\r    I did. And it's about families getting ahead. You shouldn't\n\r    have to apologize for wanting to keep what you earn. It's your\n\r    money."
