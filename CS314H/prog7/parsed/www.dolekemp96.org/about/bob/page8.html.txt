Characters:    "In 1984 Bob Dole was\n\r  elected Senate Majority Leader. He continued to fight for senior\n\r  citizens by working on a commission that saved Social Security\n\r  from bankruptcy. His greatest accomplishments as Senate\n\r  Republican Leader include leading the fight for President\n\r  Reagan's agenda of economic growth, supporting President Bush and\n\r  America's commitment to liberate Kuwait, and working with the\n\r  most recent Congress to pass a budget that will reduce the size\n\r  of the government and eliminate our deficit in seven\n\r  years."

Characters:    "In Bob Dole's\n\r  historic Congressional career, he never forgot his commitment to\n\r  the common people of Kansas who helped him through his toughest\n\r  days. It shows in his record: One of the first bills that he\n\r  introduced helped reform the public school lunch program by\n\r  reducing the price of school lunches for low-income students. One\n\r  of his last was the balanced budget amendment, which would have\n\r  saved our children and grandchildren from a stifling\n\r  debt."
