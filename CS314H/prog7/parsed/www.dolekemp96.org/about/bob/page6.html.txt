During the 1970s, he\n\r  introduced bills to balance the budget, reform welfare, fix\n\r  campaign finance laws, provide low-cost food to the disadvantaged\n\r  and reduce the power of members of Congress. As a recognized\n\r  champion of the middle class, he was named chairman of the\n\r  Republican National Committee in 1971. Then, in 1976, President\n\r  Gerald Ford tapped Senator Dole as his Vice Presidential running\n\r  mate."
