As he recently explained: \"Lawsuit abuse hurts\n\r  consumers by raising the costs of goods and services. It limits\n\r  employment opportunities for those seeking jobs. It hurts the\n\r  competitiveness of U.S. businesses overseas. And, perhaps worst\n\r  of all, it can prevent new, life-saving drugs and medical devices\n\r  from ever reaching the market.\""
