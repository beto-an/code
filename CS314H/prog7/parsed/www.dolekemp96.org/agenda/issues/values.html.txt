Ronald Reagan and\n\r  George Bush both used the Oval Office to address timely social\n\r  and value-related issues ranging from teen drug use to urban\n\r  violence and social decay. They offered visible role models for\n\r  our young people to emulate, and their leadership helped\n\r  strengthen the American family."

Characters:    "\n\r  It was those values that Bob Dole talked about last year in\n\r  Hollywood when he challenged the entertainment industry to stop\n\r  peddling gratuitous sex and random violence to our children. \"Our\n\r  music, movies, television and advertising regularly push the\n\r  limits of decency, bombarding our children with destructive\n\r  messages of casual violence and even more casual sex,\" Dole said.\n\r  \"The mainstreaming of deviancy must come to an end, but it will\n\r  only stop when the leaders of the entertainment industry\n\r  recognize their responsibility.\""
Characters:    "\n\r  "
Characters:    "\n\r  He took a similar message to Indianapolis a few months later: \"We\n\r  must speak out about our values,\" Dole said, \"and insist that our\n\r  culture and our government reflect them. Yes, this means braving\n\r  the ridicule of the cultural elites and speaking out about our\n\r  popular entertainment. Our movies and music, advertising and\n\r  television are having a profound impact on our children. And it's\n\r  not for the good.\""
Characters:    "\n\r  "
Characters:    "\n\r  Dole's message struck a chord with millions of parents and\n\r  launched a national debate over the impact popular culture has on\n\r  our children. The grassroots movement he started has borne fruit\n\r  in a voluntary television ratings system and this summer's\n\r  educational programming agreement with the major networks."
